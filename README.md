# Photonic_crystal

## Teory

This program can compute intensity of electirc field and transmition coeficient of 1D photonic crystal with defect.

First of all you need to input permitivity, permeability, lenghts of layers, angle of incidence, size of defect and number of repeating of A+B layer.
Calculations are based on
